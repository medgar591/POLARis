# POLARis / POLARroids
A simple-ish game based on polar graphs.

This game is a single screen game similar to asteroid.

The player will control a mining ship in the center of the screen.
Circles and squares will float around on the screen.
Each Circle is worth 15 points.
Hitting a square will cause the player to lose a life, but only when being moved by the player.

The controls will use the arrow keys and the space bar.
The arrow keys will move the player along a different polar graph.
The space bar will drop a bomb in the center of the screen which will cause a huge explosion collecting everything hit while being invulnerable.
Bombs will be replenished every 15? enemies (225 points?).
