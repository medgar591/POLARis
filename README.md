# POLARis
A simple-ish game based on polar graphs

This game is a side scrolling shooter.

The player will be represented by a Triangle on the Center-Left pointing Right
Enemies will be Squares that go from the Right toward the Left
Every time a square reaches the Left, the player loses a life
Each Square is worth 15 points

The controls will use the arrow keys and the space bar
The player will NOT be able to move the ship, but fire bullets that move in different patterns based on the direction
The space bar will drop a bomb in the center of the screen which will cause a huge explosion
Bombs will be replenished every 15? enemies (225?)


Example:

+===================+
|................X..| Lives: XXX
|.\.................| Bombs: OOOO
|.|>................| Score: 255
|./.........X.......|
|..................X|
+===================+
